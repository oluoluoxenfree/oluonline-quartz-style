- trying to say too much at once densely, with too many 3+ syllable words, doesn't seem to reach new people with ideas and probably means people don't engage as much with what you're saying unless they already agree? 
- i disagree a lot with people who say you have to have "done the reading" to participate in a convo - see [jargon](https://olu.online/jargon) for an attempt at explaining that - but understand that technical terms help speed up conversations for people that understand them 
- nuance is lost online; [context collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse) (where something is shared for one group of people ends up in front of another, and they don't get it, often with horrendous results and misunderstandings). people often put things down to lack of comprehension that i think is more accurately attributed to lack of context and distrust.
- trust online is a whole topic in itself - why do we trust who we do? do we have the full context and knowledge to understand what we do when we do this? - and putting trust in the wrong places is judged harshly regardless of affiliation. "how could you possibly believe that was true"
	- something about parasocial relationships and trust and communication; additional context and good will means trusting them is easier and more natural on the audience's side, but also means stakes are high to maintain good image on the performer/creator's side. 
		- parasocial relationship means that you have skin in the game, context is ample, you give them a human amount of grace (and often way too much for a stranger/person in general!)
- i am less convinced by "online is forever" arguments but i think human collective memory is waaaay more eternal than its ever been. sure, the website might be gone but someone has maybe screenshotted it, scraped the site or simply remembers what went down. people talking off the cuff on issues can make a mess for themselves easily, so it's likely people will self-censor. employers, sponsorship, away from keyboard repercussions, need for views make it easier to make a take you know is palatable, or a take you know will take off in the algorithm but might be regretful
- tying compensation to argument production - arguably a thing since the newspaper at least right - feels really weird but i guess it's just dispersed a thing that has been around forever to unpaid gig work for the majority of people doing it?
- as per i'm talking mostly about social media, we communicate in other ways online!
- public and private spheres are getting a bit more blurred in some ways; large, technically private discords, big WhatsApp groups, telegrams, etc. 
	- something about group chats and loneliness to pick up at another time?
