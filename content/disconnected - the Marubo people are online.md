| i have a London accent, and as well as the usual “bottoh o wo’er” problem, i speak fast enough to trip up native British speakers. please use the subtitles i invested in, and maybe turn down the speed if you can’t follow my speech. i promise it's me and not you! anyway, here’s the video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | i have a london accent, and as well as the usual “bottoh o wo’er” (bottle of water image?) problem i speak fast, so please use the subtitles i invested in and maybe turn down the speed if you can’t follow my speech. i promise it is me and not you ❤️ anyway, here’s the video                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| So let's think: where would you put yourself on a scale from 'extremely online' to 'never even heard of the internet'? I put myself somewhere on the extremely online side. I'm a web developer by trade, I spend an amount of time that would be embarrassing to most people on the internet on several devices at once, and even more cringeworthy is my love for the internet itself. But this isn't about my internet browsing habits, it's about you!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | on screen scale, moving myself off from the middle to off the edge of an extremely online scale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Nearly three billion people aren't on the internet; they've possibly never sent an email, searched for a fact or place on a search engine or watched a pointless video online. They may not have a connection available in their home, a mobile plan, wifi or ethernet, or even anywhere in their local area where they can get online. Given the current shape and direction of what we, for better or worse, call the "modern" world, this means a third of the world's population doesn't have the possibility of access to a wealth of opportunity, fun and exploration, and more importantly, can't fully participate in the world as it is now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | (2.6 billion or 33% or one in three people)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The UN has an - in their words - aspirational goal for everyone to have "universal and meaningful" internet access by 2030, though the number of people offline only dropped from 2.7 billion to 2.6 billion according to their reports between 2022 and 2023, the release of the last ITU report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | "safe, satisfying, enriching, productive and affordable"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [https://www.itu.int/itu-d/meetings/statistics/umc2030/](https://www.itu.int/itu-d/meetings/statistics/umc2030/)  [https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/backgrounders/Pages/connect-2030-agenda.aspx#gsc.tab=0](https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/backgrounders/Pages/connect-2030-agenda.aspx#gsc.tab=0)[capacities://f55b1743-31cc-48be-b33c-add79dceb2ed/c0ef2b66-2f0e-443d-bc19-4c15a9b5f13e?bid=e0e62e15-65e6-44a1-aa9b-27efaa344389](capacities://f55b1743-31cc-48be-b33c-add79dceb2ed/c0ef2b66-2f0e-443d-bc19-4c15a9b5f13e?bid=e0e62e15-65e6-44a1-aa9b-27efaa344389)1.4 - Ownership of and access to Internet-enabled devices for all was the one that actually stuck out but it doesn't hook into anything lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| So now, as we've said, nearly three billion people aren't on the internet. As of 2023, that's 2.6 billion people, or 1 in 3 humans on Earth. The first time I heard stats about the people not online I was shocked, but the amount of unconnected people also stood at 40%, or 2 in 5 at the beginning of 2020.   As you can see, the spread of Internet has been improving steadily.

They all have the last surname, Marubo, when dealing with the outside world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | look up pronunciation or make a point of not knowing lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| The article that broke that story, in the New York Times, makes it pretty clear that Starlink didn't provide the access out of the goodness of its corporate heart; it was Allyson Reneau, a philanthropist and numerous other things, who provided them with the hookup.

The obvious benefits; quicker emergency response times to snake bites have saved lives, for example, as well as video calls with faraway relatives and friends. The article also exposes some of the drawbacks; minors getting access to pornography; the siren call of the internet in general meaning people forget their responsibilities — relatable to be honest — and understandably, arguments over the place of the internet within their lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The NYT's article, however, doesn't point out a bunch of other things. Reporting by an independent news site 404 media, shows that the Marubo people have had access to the internet for some time, just not high speed access, any time they fancied it. The problems and benefits I listed weren't alien concepts to them before the Starlink connection. They've used Orkut, a social media site that was online from the early 2000s to 2014, and have been on Facebook since. Enoque Marubo, who I mentioned earlier, has been on Instagram since 2013, and follows many other Marubo people. The Marubo people have been online for literal decades!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | In a phone call, Ruedas told me that many Marubo families live in “multi-sited households,” meaning they have a home in the forest and also one in the town of Atalaia do Norte, where a lot of children and teens will go to school, families interact with the pension or political system, and use the internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| As we can see in the news stories and sensationalist headlines, there's a real temptation to see indigenous people as a monolith and ignore the real barriers to their self-directed and firmly self-chosen flourishing. As Enroque puts it: “We are an Amazonian tribe that for more than 100 years has been in contact with non-Indigenous society. Full isolation has not existed for a long time … there are still people who defend the idea that indigenous people should remain isolated and alienated from technology. This view is primitive and ignores the fundamental right of Indigenous peoples to decide their own futures and to have access to the same opportunities as anyone else.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | “We are an Amazonian tribe that for more than 100 years has been in contact with non-Indigenous society.

| "For the most part, consortiums of tech and telecoms companies build the cables, and often resell bandwidth on the fibre lines to customers around the world. An email sent from London to New York across one of these cables can travel in under 70 milliseconds (0.07 seconds). Satellites, by contrast, are able to carry far less data and are much more expensive to launch and run. They account for a tiny fraction of intercontinental data transport and will do so for decades to come.  For years, the subsea cable sector was driven by investments from largely state-owned telecoms operators, but over the past decade tech groups have taken their place. US tech behemoths, including Google, Meta and Microsoft, invested about 2bn in cables between 2016 and 2022, accounting for 15 per cent of the worldwide total. Over the next three years, they will pump in a further 3.9bn, or 35 per cent of the total." | [sick of graphs](https://app.capacities.io/f55b1743-31cc-48be-b33c-add79dceb2ed/c94d4511-fd53-4385-ad28-f28052f900fd)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [How the US is pushing China out of the internet’s plumbing](https://app.capacities.io/f55b1743-31cc-48be-b33c-add79dceb2ed/52b7f930-a876-4087-9deb-9df8e960f88b)  [subsea bandiwidth used by different actors](https://app.capacities.io/f55b1743-31cc-48be-b33c-add79dceb2ed/759d41c5-05df-4413-aed7-ee28a8eebee9)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Actually, another quick aside. I and many other people dislike the term "developing countries"; it creates a sense of hierarchy or superiority and often it's not a meaningful grouping, much like other terms such as "the Global South" when New Zealand is the southernmost country by many measures but is considered part of the Global North...
