sewing can't all be done by a machine
a human has touched and worked on every garment you own
most of the tech applied to fashion is materials, processes that aren't the actual garment construction, which i think has stayed largely unchanged for a long time
online shopping obvs has hugely shaped things
AI in supply chains - hyper-personalisation, small batches but loads of them ala zara and shein
the design side mayyyybe has been influenced by tech/is it being automated but only in the most unhelpful to designers/workers/people way?
