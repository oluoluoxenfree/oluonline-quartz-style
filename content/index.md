hello there! i'm [Olu](https://olu.online/about).

finished pieces live or are linked to on my [blog](https://olu.online/blog). 

this [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) is for thinking out loud, sketching things out, getting feedback and [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)/[working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ)/[showing my work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/). 

please [get in touch](https://olu.online/contact) if anything strikes a nerve or speaks to you, or you have something else to share.

## Currently thinking about:

- [[luddites]]
- [[small web]]
- [[tiny internets]]
- [[permacomputing]]
- [[anti-universities]]

wishing you more than well. ðŸ’Ÿ
