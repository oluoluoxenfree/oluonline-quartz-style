hello there! i'm [Olu](https://olu.online/about).

finished pieces live or are linked to on my [blog](https://olu.online/blog). 

this [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) is for thinking out loud, sketching things out, getting feedback and [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)/[working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ)/[showing my work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/). 

please [get in touch](https://olu.online/contact) if anything strikes a nerve or speaks to you, or you have something else to share.

## Currently thinking about:

- [[content ideas i have not yet fleshed out, so help me god]]

## Things I have thought about:

trying to think of a term that over-arcs all of the below:

- [[luddites]]
- [[small web]]
- [[tiny internets]]
- [[permacomputing]]

2024-06-29: so that didn't work!! so we're gonna actually sit with the fact that there are multitudes lol. in the deep vein of "you can literally change it as soon as someone raises a good objection" we are going with [[possible technologies]].

wishing you more than well. ðŸ’Ÿ
