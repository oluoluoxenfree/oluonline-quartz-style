I wrote a piece that mentioned [university abolition](https://olu.online/abolition/#university-abolition).

I think I am still pretty in love with the ideal of a university — a place people can go and learn what their hearts desire and live a life of the mind — and desperately let down by the reality. 

I love the [recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/) and other attempts at free education. 

Struggling against the urge to ask "how do we scale and grow such attempts?" Things can be sustainable at the size they are without constant growth.
