Reading [Blood in the Machine](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/) (the book, that's the substack by the author, Brian Merchant). 

Just learnt that Ned Ludd of Luddism is apocryphal so wonder what else I'll learn!

Really enjoyed Brian Merchant's [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/new-luddites-ai-protest/677327/) about the new Luddites too. 

Trying to work out if I want to put a definition in here but I guess there's no need, this is for my original thoughts and learnings I guess!
